The island, about 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) west of the Jawaharlal Nehru Port, consists of five Hindu caves, a few Buddhist stupa mounds that date back to the 2nd century BCE, and two Buddhist caves with water tanks.\n",
      "The Elephanta Caves contain rock-cut stone sculptures, mostly in high relief, that show syncretism of Hindu and Buddhist ideas and iconography. The caves are hewn from solid basalt rock. Except for a few exceptions, much of the artwork is defaced and damaged. The main temple's orientation as well as the relative location of other temples are placed in a mandala pattern. The carvings narrate Hindu legends, with the large monolithic 5.45 metres (17.9 ft) Trimurti Sadashiva (three-faced Shiva), Nataraja (Lord of dance) and Yogishvara (Lord of Yogis) being the most celebrated.\n",
      "These date to between the 5th and 9th centuries, and scholars attribute them to various Hindu dynasties. They are most commonly placed between the 5th and 7th centuries. Many scholars consider them to have been completed by about 550 CE.\n",
      "They were named Elefante—which morphed to Elephanta—by the colonial Portuguese who found elephant statues on the caves. They established a base on the island. The main cave (Cave 1, or the Great Cave) was a Hindu place of worship until the Portuguese arrived, whereupon the island ceased to be an active place of worship. The earliest attempts to prevent further damage to the caves were started by British India officials in 1909. The monuments were restored in the 1970s. It is currently maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).\n",

In literature In her 1834 poetical illustration The Caves of Elephanta, to an engraving of a painting by W. Purser, Letitia Elizabeth Landon laments the loss of the original spiritual purpose of this vast structure, so that now: 'The mighty shrine, undeified, speaks force, and only force, Man's meanest attribute'. The Sadashiva is a colossal carving, a bit over 6.27 metres (20.6 ft), depicting Tatpurusha (Mahadeva), Aghora (Bhairava), Vamadeva (Uma) and Sadyojata (Nandin). More specific legislation to preserve the Elephanta Island monuments were enacted with the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act of 1958 and Rules (1959); The Elephanta Island (Protected Monument) Rules of 1957, which prohibits mining, quarrying, blasting, excavation and other operations near the monument; the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act promulgated in 1972 with its Rules promulgated in 1973; a Notification issued in 1985 declaring the entire island and a 1-kilometre (0.62 mi) area from the shore as \"a prohibited area\"; a series of Maharashtra State Government environmental acts protecting the site; the 1966 Regional and Town Planning Act; and the 1995 Heritage Regulations for Greater Bombay. Cave 1: Main, Great Cave The main cave, also called Cave 1, Grand Cave or the Great Cave, is 39.63 metres (130.0 ft) square in plan with a hall (mandapa). In Shaivism, the concept pictorially symbolises the transcendence of all duality including gender, with the spiritual lacking any distinctions, where energy and power (Shakti, Parvati) is unified and is inseparable with the soul and awareness (Brahman, Shiva). The island, about 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) west of the Jawaharlal Nehru Port, consists of five Hindu caves, a few Buddhist stupa mounds that date back to the 2nd century BCE, and two Buddhist caves with water tanks. One features the abstract, unmanifest, aniconic symbol of Shiva, the other anthropomorphic, manifest, iconic symbol of Shiva. Next, along the face of the eastern hill to the north of Sitabai's cave is Cave 7 (18.965100°N 72.934766°E﻿ / 18.965100; 72.934766), another small excavation with a veranda, which was probably to be three cells, but was abandoned following the discovery of a flaw in the rock.\n",

      "The larger group of caves, which consists of five caves on the western hill of the island, is well known for its Hindu sculptures.\n",
      "The temple complex is primarily the abode of Shiva, depicted in widely celebrated carvings which narrate legends and theologies of Shaivism.\n",
      "The cave's main entrance is aligned with the north–south axis, unusual for a Shiva shrine (normally east–west).\n",
      "The northern entrance to the cave is flanked by two panels of Shiva dated to the Gupta period, both damaged.\n",
      "The central Shiva relief Trimurti is located on the south wall opposite the main entrance.\n",
      "The carving is unusual because the standard ancient Hindu texts for murti design state that the Tatpursha should face east, but in Elephanta it is the north face (pointing towards the main entrance).\n",
      "It is carved in relief on the south wall of the cave facing the north entrance, along the north–south axis.\n",
      "The Gangadhara image is highly damaged, particularly the lower half of Shiva seen seated with Parvati, who is shown with four arms, two of which are broken.\n",
      "It is represented as half woman shown as half of Parvati in this Elephanta panel on the right side, with breast, waist, feminine hair and items such as a mirror in the upper hand.\n",
      "In the panel, the relief shows a headdress (double-folded) with two pleats draped towards the female head (Parvati) and the right side (Shiva) depicting curled hair and a crescent.\n",
      "Shiva slaying Andhaka The panel in the northwest side of the cave, on the wall near west entrance and the Linga shrine (see 7 in plan), is an uncommon sculpture about the Andhakasura-vadha legend.\n",
      "Also depicted in his right hand is the symbolic weapon that Shaiva scriptures states Shiva used to kill the destructive elephant demon.\n",
      "Wedding of Shiva The niche image carved on the southwest wall, near the Linga shrine (see 6 on plan) is the wedding of Shiva and Parvati.\n",
      "Parvati is seen standing to Shiva's right, the customary place for a Hindu bride at the wedding.\n",
      "The carvings are substantially damaged, but the ruined remains of the sculpture have been significant to scholarly studies of Hindu literature.\n",
      "Yogishvara: Lord of Yoga The panel in the east side of the portico next to the north entrance (see 9 on plan) is Shiva in Yoga.\n",
      "Yogi Shiva, or Lakulisa, wears a crown here, his chest is shown vaulting forward as if in breathing exercises found in Hindu yoga texts, the face and body expresses different energy.\n",
      "This Shiva yogi comes across as the \"lord of the caves\" or Guhesvara in medieval Indian poetry, states Kramrisch.\n",
      "According to Charles Collins, the depiction of Shiva as Yogi in Elephanta Cave 1 is harmonious with those found in the Puranas dated to early and mid 1st millennium CE.\n",
      "Nataraja: Lord of Dance The panel facing the Yogishvara, on the west side of the portico next to the north entrance (see 8 on plan) is Shiva as the Nataraja, \"cosmic dancer\" and \"the lord of dancers\".\n",
      "There are fewer gods, goddesses and observers in this panel than others in this cave, with Brahma, Vishnu, Lakshmi, Saraswati and Parvati are visible and have a facial expression of being spellbound.\n",
      "Linga shrine The central shrine of the Great Cave temple is a free-standing square stone cella, with entrances on each of its sides.\n",
      "Schastok, the Skanda in the east shrine of Elephanta Cave 1 is significant, just like the one found in Deogarh Hindu temple site, because he is depicted with regalia, weapons and icons similar to Shiva and because he is surrounded by gods and goddesses.\n",
      "The western face has two panels, one showing another version of Shiva in Yoga (see 14 on plan) and another Nataraja (see 15 on plan).\n",
      "The central door at the back of the portico leads to a damaged shrine, the sanctum seems to be for a Linga, but that is lost.\n",
      "Lost monuments Many artworks from the Elephanta Caves ruins are now held in major museums around India.\n",
      "Other scholarly studied museum held Elephanta sculpture includes a part of Brahma head, several ruins of Vishnu from different statues, a range of panels and free-standing stone carvings.\n",
      "Another theory by some scholars, such as Moti Chandra, suggests that the island once had open-air structural Hindu temples in addition to the caves, but these were the first victims of art destruction.\n",
      "According to Archaeological Survey of India and UNESCO, the site was settled in ancient times and the cave temples were built between 5th and 6th century.\n",
      "The dating to a mid 6th century completion and it being a predominantly Shiva monument built by a Hindu Kalachuri king is based on numismatic evidence, inscriptions, construction style and better dating of other Deccan cave temples including the Ajanta Caves, and the more firm dating of Dandin's Dasakumaracarita.\n",
      "According to Charles Collins, the significance of the Elephanta Caves is better understood by studying them in the context of ancient and early medieval Hindu literature, as well as in the context of other Buddhist, Hindu and Jain cave temples on the subcontinent.\n",
      "The accounts varies significantly in these texts and has been much distorted by later interpolations, but the Elephanta Cave panels represent the narrative version most significant in the 6th century.\n",
      "Scholars are divided on who most defaced and damaged the Elephanta Caves.\n",
      "The Portuguese ceded the island in 1661 to the colonial British, but by then the Caves had seen considerable damage.\n",
      "The Elephanta caves re-emerged as a center of Hindu worship, and according to British administration records, the government charged the pilgrims a temple tax at least since 1872.\n",
      "The earliest efforts to preserve the Elephanta Caves were taken by British India officials in 1909 when the site was placed under the Indian Archaeological Department and the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act included it within its scope.\n",

Elephanta Island, or Gharapuri, is about 11 km (6.8 mi) east of the Gateway of India in the Mumbai Harbour and less than 2 km (1.2 mi) west of Jawaharlal Nehru Port. The island has volcanic origins, and was formed during an eruptive sequence of the Deccan Traps volcanic province during the latest Cretaceous or earliest Paleocene. The island is 2.4 km (1.5 mi) in length with two hills that rise to a height of about 150 m (490 ft) The Elephanta Caves is connected by ferry services from the Gateway of India, Mumbai between 9AM and 2PM daily, except Monday when the Caves are closed. The island has two groups of rock-cut caves, hewn from solid basalt rock. The larger group of caves, which consists of five caves on the western hill of the island, is well known for its Hindu sculptures. The primary cave, numbered as Cave 1, is about 1.0 km (0.62 mi) up a hillside. All the caves are rock-cut temples that together have an area of 5,600 m2 (60,000 sq ft) At their most elaborate, they have a main chamber, two lateral chambers, courtyards, and subsidiary shrines. Cave 1 is the largest and is 39 metres (128 ft) deep from the front entrance to the back. To reach the main cave, a visitor or pilgrim has to walk up 120 steep steps from the ticket counter. The temple is enclosed in the cave, it has interior walls but no exterior wall. Embedded within the Great Cave are dedicated shrines, the largest of which is the square plan Linga shrine (see 16 in plan) Each doorway is guarded by a dvarapala on each side, for a total of eight. Steps lead from the four doorways into the sanctum, which has a linga in the mulavigraha style. The northern entrance to the cave is flanked by two panels of Shiva dated to the Gupta period. Each wall has large carvings of Shiva-related legends, each more than 5 metres (16 ft) in height. The central Shiva relief Trimurti is located on the south wall opposite the main entrance. Smaller shrines are located at the east and west ends of the caves. The Trimurti is considered a masterpiece and the most important sculpture in the caves. It is carved in relief on the south wall of the cave facing the north entrance. The image, 7 m (23 ft) in height, depicts a three-headed Shiva, representing Panchamukha Shiva. The three-headed Shiva are his creator, preserver and destroyer aspects in Shaivism. They are equivalently symbolism for Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma. The Gangadhara image is highly damaged, particularly the lower half of Shiva seen seated with Parvati. In this grotto scene, Shiva is sculpted and bedecked with ornaments, while gods gather to watch the cosmic source of earthly abundance. The gods and goddesses shown are identifiable from the vahana (vehicle) and icons. They include Brahma, Indra, Vishnu, Saraswati, Indrani, Lakshmi, and others. Ardhanarishvara represents the ancient Hindu concept of essential interdependence of the feminine and the masculine aspects in the universe. In Shaivism, the concept pictorially symbolises the transcendence of all duality including gender, with the spiritual lacking any distinctions. The Ardhanarishwara is an uncommon sculpture about the Andhakasura-vadha legend. It shows Bhairava, or Virabhadra, a ferocious form of Shiva killing the demon Andhaka. The front left hand is broken, while a large part of the lower half of the panel was damaged at some point. The relief is 3.5 m (11 ft) high and posed in action. The legs and five of the eight arms are broken, attributed to Portuguese vandalism. Bhairava's headgear has a ruff on the back, a skull, and a cobra over the forehead. The Elephanta Cave carvings show the wedding of Shiva and Parvati. Parvati is seen standing to Shiva's right, the customary place for a Hindu bride at the wedding. In many surviving versions of the Puranas, the wedding takes place in King Parvata's palace. Gods, goddesses and celestial apsaras are cheering witness. Panel in the east side of the portico next to the north entrance is Shiva in Yoga. This form of Shiva is called Yogishvara, Mahayogi, Lakulisa. Shiva, states Stella Kramrisch, is the \"primordial yogi\" in this panel. Elephanta Cave 1 shows Shiva as the Nataraja, \"cosmic dancer\" and \"the lord of dancers\" The panel facing the Yogishvara is 4 m (13 ft) wide and 3.4 m (11 ft) high. This is an eight-armed depiction of Nataraja. and arms are shown as wildly gyrating in the lalita mudra. The dancer and destroyer aspects of Shiva are clustered in the northwest part of the cave, in contrast to yoga and creator aspects that are found in the northeast parts. The carvings at the east entrance are battered and blurry. One depicts Shiva and Parvati in Mount Kailash in the Himalayas. The scene is crowded with accessory figures, which may be because the eastern entrance was meant to have a devotional focus. A portion of ascetic skeletal devotee Bhringi relief survives. The central shrine of the Great Cave temple is a free-standing square stone cella, with entrances on each of its sides. Each door is flanked by two dvarapalas (gate guardians), for a total of eight around the shrine. In the centre is the mulavigraha Linga, which is the abstract unmanifest symbol of Shiva in union with the Yoni. On the east side of the main hall is a separate shrine. It is a 17 m (56 ft)-wide courtyard with a circular pedestal. It once had a seated Nandi facing the Linga shrine, but its ruins have not been restored. The Shakti panel in the east shrine is unusual in that counting Parvati, it features eight mothers. Skanda in the east shrine of Elephanta Cave 1 is significant because he is depicted with regalia, weapons and icons similar to Shiva. By portraying Skanda with Matrikas, he is equated with the Krittikas legend and thereby Kartikeya. The west side of the main hall is another attached shrine, though in a much more ruined state. This Yogi Shiva panel is damaged, but unlike the other Yogi depiction, here the leg position in Yoga asana has survived. The Yogishvara is seated on a lotus, and near him are two badly defaced characters, possibly one of Parvati and another ascetic. Portico is 26 m (85 ft) long and 11 m (36 ft) deep and is supported by four reconstructed pillars. At the back of the portico are three chambers, one on each side of the shrine. Cave 4 is quite damaged, the large verandah lacking all its columns. The relief remains suggest the cave was once a Shaiva temple. Cave 6 is a large hall known as Sitabai's temple cave. It was converted and used as a Christian church by the Portuguese in the later years when the island was a part of their colony. The hall has 3 chambers at the back, the central one a shrine and the rest for monks or priests. Many artworks from the Elephanta Caves ruins are now held in major museums around India. These include an almost completely destroyed Durga statue with only the buffalo demon with Durga's legs and some waist surviving. Other scholarly studied museum held sculpture includes a part of Brahma head, several ruins of Vishnu from different statues and free-standing stone carvings. The Vishnu sculptures found among the Elephanta ruins express different styles. One wears a dhoti and has a looped girdle, while holding a conch at an angle near his thigh. Another statue has elements of Shiva and Vishnu. The island also had a stone horse according to 18th century records. Elephanta caves are believed to have been built by the Rashtrakutas in the 7th century or after. Coins of the Kshatrapas (Western Satraps) dating to the 4th century CE were found on the island. According to Archaeological Survey of India and UNESCO the site was settled in ancient times and the cave temples were built between 5th and 6th century. The Elephanta Caves are believed to have been built in the mid 6th century by king Krishnaraja of the Kalachuri dynasty. They are based on numismatic evidence, inscriptions, construction style and better dating of other Deccan cave temples. Elephanta Caves were completed in the 6th century CE. The island was once part of the Gujarat Sultanate. It was ceded to the Portuguese merchants in 1534. The elephant statue was damaged in attempts to relocate it to England. The Elephanta Caves were defaced and damaged during the colonial period. The colonial era British publications state they were \"defaced by the zeal of Mahommedans and Portuguese\" The Portuguese ceded the island in 1661 to the colonial British, but by then the Caves had seen considerable damage. The caves re-emerged as a center of Hindu worship. Elephants Caves were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987. The caves \"represent a masterpiece of human creative genius\" and \"bear a unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilisation which is living or which has disappeared\" The earliest efforts to preserve the Elephanta Caves were taken by British India officials in 1909 when the site was placed under the Indian Archaeological Department. The Ancient Monuments Preservation Act included it within its scope. This helped isolate the island and preserve the ruins. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Aurangabad Circle maintains and manages the Elephanta Caves. The site receives approximately 1,000 visitors a day, more on Shiva ratri, dance festivals, the World Heritage Day (18 April) and World Heritage Week. The Elephanta Caves are mentioned more than once in Herman Melville's Moby Dick, and also feature in Somerset Maugham's 1944 novel The Razor's Edge. The cave is said to have been the birthplace of Shiva. Adam Hardy (2015). Theory and Practice of Temple Architecture in Medieval India. Stella Kramrisch (1976). The Hindu Temple Volume 1.
